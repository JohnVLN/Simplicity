# Simplicity
Single page web app made with **Angular 20** framework.

> It is a basic portfolio, where I will be showcasing projects and updating with new skills I learn.

### Todos
- [x] Navbar on the left side of the desktop view
- [ ] All content should be nested inside a window with rounded corners
- [ ] Implement light/dark mode switch

Desirable:
- Lander page with minimalist fullscreen design
- Ability to hide the navbar
- Animated gradients in background ~~(this one would kill me)~~
